# Data Plane Transfer

This module provides extensions for performing data transfer through the Data Plane. Each extension is designed to
support one type of data transfer.

## Extensions

- [Data Plane Transfer Client](data-plane-transfer-client/README.md) provides a client to delegate data transfer to the Data Plane.
- [Data Plane Transfer Sync](data-plane-transfer-sync/README.md) provides services to use the Data Plane as a proxy for querying data from the provider data source.
